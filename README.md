# React Eco App

This project is to familirize myself with common React libraries (Redux, Thunk, etc..) and writing test for them.

## Installation

To install dependencies, run the following:

```
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Builds and starts app.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
